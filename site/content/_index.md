  heading: UX, UI, CX, HTML, CSS, HI, ML, VR, AR & MORE
  text: "There are a whole lot of acronyms, tools, technologies and screens out
    there. User behaviors are evolving rapidly and each design problem requires
    insight and consideration while maintaining focus on business goals. None of
    this happens easily or by accident. Great design needs a process: the work
    must be nurtured, considered, verified in the real world and then improved
    through rigor."

values:
  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
